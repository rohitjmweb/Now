<h4>Reading:</h4>
	<p>My reading has hit a slump for the last six months, so time to get back on the groove.<br>
	Have been meaning to explore David Graeber's body of work, so that's the primary reading for the next three months. I generally read several books at once,
	so would get ahead on the <a href="https://muleyrohit.github.io/Bookshelf/2022.html">2022</a> list with some novels for intellectual relief.<br>
	Aiming to read ~ 30 hours a week at a decent pace. Roughly 4 hours a day, but daily targets never work for me.
	</p><br>
	
	<h4>Writing:</h4>
	<p>Compiling a few essays I have been passively working on since a long time. Trying to streamline my very divergent writing process and publish regularly.
	No time targets, more or less an anchoring work currently.
	</p><br>
	
	
	
	
	 
	<h4>JavaScript:</h4>
	 <p>Focussing on reinforcing JavaScript. I know enough to get by, but this time I aim to get good at it from a professional perspective.
	Following the process prescribed by <a href="https://sive.rs/learn-js">Derek Sivers</a> along with a couple of ideas of my own.<br>
	This will also address any of my current or future full-stack requirements towards this website.

	
        
	</p><br>
	 
	 <h4>French:</h4>
	 <p>Deep Diving into learning French. I follow an unorthodox method, trying to formalise it a bit through deadlines and 
         <a href="immersion.html">immersion</a>.<br>
	 Focussing most on reading, which is most relevant to me at the moment.
